## Classical approach
- Assume people are rational
- Managers tell workers what to do
- Managers motivate workers with money (bonus or penalty)
### Scientific management (~taylorism)
>Improve the work and the worker for maximised efficiency

Key ideas:
- Carefully design jobs with efficient work methods
- Select workers with the abilities to do these jobs and train them
- Train supervisors to support workers
- Set work standards (sometimes with incentives)

Advantages:
- Can create highly efficient work methods
- Can set specific work standards/targets

Disadvantages
- Disenfranchises workers, no room for creativity
- Treated as a cog, can only do one thing
- Metrics quite arbitrary

Insights
- Seems to try to optimize the output/efficiency but doesn't worry about worker growth

### Administrative management
>Improve the manager by applying 'universal principles' of efficient management

Key ideas:
- Good management can be taught
- Five duties of management
- [Fayol's 14 principles of management](https://www.simplilearn.com/principles-of-management-by-henri-fayol-article)
- Shared goals to reduce conflict

Advantages:
- Supports teamwork
- Motivates workers with respect

Disadvantages:
- Implementation varies depending on manager
- Requires a clear organisational heirarchy

### Bureaucratic management
>Improve the efficiency by developing the 'ideal' organisation

Key ideas:
- Clear division of labour
- Clear hierarchy of authority
- Careers based on merit - are you good at what you do? avoids nepotism/favoritism
- Formal rules and procedures
- Impersonality

Advantages:
- Highly scalable
- Produces reliable, consistent systems

Disadvantages:
- Can be highly inefficient (too much 'red tape')
- Inflexible to change

## Behavioural (HR) approach
- Begun after a study (Mayo 1927-1933) found money not the cause of increased output.
- Abraham Maslow (1908-1970)
	- Maslow's hierarchy of needs
	- Deficit and progression principle
- Douglas McGregor (1906 - 1964)
	- Theory X and Theory Y
- Let people participate in deciding what to do
- Give responsibility where appropriate
- Money alone is not a significant motivator

### Elton Mayo's conclusions
- Workers have needs other than money, such as:
	- Need for recognition
	- Need for security (not going to get fired out of nowhere, job security)
	- Need for a sense of belonging
- Intelligence is not restricted to management

### Maslow's hierarchy of needs
![](images/Pasted%20image%2020240726122311.png)
- The need for recognition, security, and sense of belonging is more important in determining workers' morale and productivity than the physical conditions under which they work

### McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y
- Two different perspectives on people's motivation to work
- Theory X
	- The average human has an inherent dislike of work and will avoid it if possible
	- X managers think
		- Most people have to be coerced and controlled to get them to put enough effort towards furthering the goals of the organisation
		- The average person *wants* to be directed, wishes to avoid responsibility, has low ambition, wants security above all
	- Scientific management approach?
- Theory Y
	- People are internally motivated and enjoy their work
	- Y managers think
		- Work is natural - the average person does not dislike it
		- External control and threats aren't the only way to motivate people
		- The average person can learn to accept and seek responsibility
	- Behavioural management approach?
## Quantitative management
- Reskinned scientific management with mathematical modelling
- Operations management using quantitative techniques for forecasting, inventory, etc
- Management accounting

## Modern management
- Systems theory
- Theory Z (American vs Japanese styles)
- TQM (Total Quality Management)
- ISO 9000 (proposed universal standard for management)
- Contingency theory
