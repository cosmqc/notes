Ethics matter in engineering
> Our society needs professionals who "do the right thing"

A professional engineer needs to be able to:
- identify the different and someti,es competing ethical concerns they may face
- analyse the issues that might underlie those concerns
- respond effectively to those concerns

Our goal is to use existing principles to make ethically sound decisions using our
- Personal sense of right and wrong
- Understanding of ethical theories
- Systematic decision-making process

## Ethics
### What is Ethics?
- The study of moral principles
- What ought to be done
- What character a person ought to be
- What values and morals a person ought to adopt

### Values
Ethical values
- Directly relate to personal beliefs about what is right and proper
Non-ethical values
- Ethically neutral (not unethical)
- Relate not to morality but to desire (wealth, power, happiness)

## Ethical theories
### Rule based thinking (Deontology)
An act is ethical if certain ethical rules are obeyed, regardless of the situation or outcomes
- Often absolutist
- Simple to understand (follow rules -> ethical, don't follow rules -> unethical)
- What are the rules? Who decides?
	- Obey universal laws? What are they?
	- Obey the word of God? Whose God?
	- Obey the law? Is this enough?
#### The Law
Ethics - what a person ought to do
Law - what a person is required to do by the state, differs between states
- Laws evolve with culture
- Establishes a minimum standard of conduct

#### Universal Laws
Categorical Imperative
> An act is moral only if we could accept it being made into a universal law. That law must not treat people as a means to an end

> Imagine a society where everyone did an act. Does that society function?

#### Rights
People have fundamental rights that other people have a duty to respect
- Free consent
- Privacy
- Freedom of conscience
- Be told the truth
- Life and safety
- Freedom of speech
- Freedom of choice
Not always possible to simultaneously uphold the rights of all parties, i.e.
- Right to free speech vs right to feel safe and respected
- Right to privacy vs right to security
- Right to community public health vs right to free assembly

**Human Rights Act 1993**
**NZ Bill of Rights Act 1990**
**Privacy Act 2020**

#### Justice
Actions must be just and fair (legal requirements are just the minimum)
Again not always possible to simultaneously be fair to all parties
- Distributive justice / Equity
>Different treatment of people should not be based on arbitrary characteristics
- Procedural justice / Impartiality
> Rules should be clearly stated and consistently and impartially enforced
- Compensatory justice / fairness
> Compensated for injury by responsible party

#### The Golden Rule
>Treat others as you would wish to be treated
- Assumes your needs and wants are the same as everyone elses
- Does not distinguish between competing stakeholders
> Treat people the way **they** wish to be treated 

### Prima Facie
Fidelity - Keep promises and don't tell lies
Reparation - Fix what you have done wrong
Gratitude - To parents and benefactors
Justice - Beyond the letter of the law
Beneficence - Do good if you can
Self-improvement - Make yourself better (so you can do better for others)
Non-maleficence - Do not injure others
### Ends based thinking (Consequentialism)
>An act is ethical when they achieve the best outcome
>The ends justify the means 
- Teleology is similar, slightly different
- Flexible, not absolute
- How to judge the 'best' outcome?
	- Who is this best for? (me, family, most people?)
	- Can we judge this accurately?
### Utilitarianism
>Acts are ethical when they achieve the greatest good for the greatest number
>It is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong
- Assess good and bad outcomes
- Consider short and long term
- Consider all affected stakeholders (often done w cost-benefit analysis)
- Only considers the overall happiness/suffering, not the distribution
- Difficult to quantify 'happiness'/'suffering' -> see 'monetary cost of a human life'
#### Stakeholders
- All entities meaningfully affected by the outcome
- Includes both positive and negative outcomes
- May include non-human entities - animals, the environment, etc.
### Virtue based thinking
