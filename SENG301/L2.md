#SENG301

Without a vision, agile doesn't work. Ends up with a frankenstein of ideas.

### Epic
- large piece of work that can be over multiple sprints
- abstract high-level requirement
- similar to story, but defined more loosely
- must be broken down further

How to know if it's an epic?
- can we break it down further and still get value out of it?
- are there multiple outputs? (api, mobile, etc)
### Story
* piece of work that must be completed in one sprint

A user story is a system's functionality from the user's viewpoint.
- One goal, one interaction, one purpose
- Written in natural language, non technical
- As a \<role>, I \<action> so that \<value>
	- needs 'so that' otherwise:
		- that feature doesn't provide value to the user, or
		- the user doesn't know enough about the feature to define it

### Task
1. split the stories between the team
2. 
## Product backlog and sprint backlog
### Product backlog
The stack of work to be done eventually, has everything that is planned to be done at some point. Can change often as the vision changes.
### Sprint backlog
The amount of work the PO and dev team have agreed to be done in this sprint.
Will not change unless under emergency situation (massive bug, huge change in vision).
Any change to current sprint backlog must be agreed between the PO and the dev team.

## Kanban
Work in process principle.

## Definitions of READY/DONE
