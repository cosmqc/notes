Spiral repeats steps of a project starting with smaller goals and expanding outwards in iterations called **rounds**. Each round is considered an individual project or milestone and may follow other software development methodologies. 
i.e. in SENG202 we used a spiral method using three rounds of [[Waterfall]].

When looking at a spiral model diagram, the spiral's radius represents the project's cost, and the slope of the line (relative to the center) respresents the progress made in the current phase.
