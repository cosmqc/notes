Web security requirements
- Secrecy to prevent eavesdroppers to learn sensitive info
- Entity authentication
- Message authentication/integrity to prevent message alteration/injection

IP security
- Not shown to end users and applications
Security above TCP
- Part of the underlying protocol suite, so also not shown to applications
Application-specific security
- Embedded within the particular application

#### Goals of SSL/TLS
- Authentication
	- Server side is always authenticated
	- Client side is optionally authenticated (amazon doesn't care as long as you have money)
- Integrity
	- Data sent after the connection is established cannot be modified by attackers without detection
- Confidentiality
	- Data sent after the connection is established is only visible to the endpoints (cannot be intercepted)
