Serial communications is the process of sending/receiving bits over a write one-at-a-time.
Tx buffer used by a transmitter, and a Rx buffer used by a receiver. If a device is both a transmitter and receiver, it has both buffers. Usually sent using packets.
### Simplex
- One way communication (unidirectional)
	- One device acts as transmitter, and the other as a receiver.

### Full Duplex
- Two way communication (bidirectional)
	- Both devices act as transmitters and receivers
- Tx and Rx happening simultaneously

### Half Duplex
- Two way communication (bidirectional)
	- Both devices act as transmitters and receivers
- Either transmitting **or** receiving at one time
- Data rate is halved compared to full duplex
- Uses time-divison multiplexing to coordinate who is transmitting/receiving

## Packet structure

- When no data is being sent, the line is idle at HIGH.
- Baud rate measured in bits per second
- Start bit (0)
- Data (LSB first usually, I2C uses MSB first)
- [[#Parity bit]]
- Stop bit (1)

### Parity bit
A parity bit is an extra bit added, usually immediately after the data section of the packet.
It's optional, but is a simple and relatively effective way of detecting errors in transmission.
There is even and odd parity. If you sum the data section and the parity bit, the resulting number should be even or odd (depending on the parity type, even parity -> even sum).
If the resulting number doesn't match the parity type, then at least one bit has been flipped.
A single parity bit can only detect one bit error, but doesn't know where it is.

## UART
On the TIVA boards, the main form of serial communications is by using UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter).
UART:
- is available in many MCUs
- is usually full duplex
- often has extra handshaking pins for flow control (i.e. clear-to-send pin (CTS))

UART on the TIVA boards:
- there are eight UARTs (U0 to U7), each with two 16-byte FIFO buffers for Tx and Rx
- Programmable baudrate generator up to 10Mbps
- Autogenerated start, stop, and parity bits (configurable if needed)
- Is able to be used in a blocking *or* non-blocking fashion

### Blocking vs Non-blocking transmission
Blocking transmission means that no other code can execute while the transmission is happening. This isn't ideal when we are doing time sensitive actions like calculating PID values, or polling user-inputs. Typically we will want to do the transmission asynchronously (non-blocking) so the rest of the program can execute while the transmission is being processed. This is done by breaking the data up into packets and sending them one at a time; if another process needs to execute something, the UART just stops sending and resumes once the second process is done.
