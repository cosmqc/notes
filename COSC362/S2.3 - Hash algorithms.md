> Message or data authentication is a procedure that allows communicating parties to verify that received or stored messages are authentic (contents have not been altered, source is authentic, timing/sequence relative to other messages)

Message authentication code -> use of a secret code to generate a small chunk of data thats appended to the message. serves as a checksum. receiver then re-generates code and compares it to the one the sender sent

Cryptographic hash functions
- Length of HASH(m) much shorter than m, always the same size
- Requirements to be a hash function
	- H can be applied to a block of data of any size
	- H produces a fixed-length output (always the same)
	- It is easy to compute H(x) from any block of data x
	- From any given H(x), computationally infeasible to find x
	- Strong collision resistance -> can't find _any_ two values X, Y so that their hashes are the same
	- weak collision resistance -> given a _specific_ X can't find any Y, so that their hashes are the same

Birthday paradox
- How many people do you have to have in a room before it is likely two people share the same birthday
- With only 23 people -> ~50.7% chance of collision
- First person has 365/365 chance, second has 364/365, third has 363/365, etc
- Summing these find
### Message digest algorithms
- developed by Ronald Rivest
- MD2, MD4, MD5
	- MD5 is the secure version of MD4, but vulnerable to collision attacks

### SHA family
- Secure Hash Algorithm
- SHA0, SHA1, SHA2, SHA3
	- SHA0 and SHA1 are vulnerable to collision attacks

- Password hashing
	- Store hash value, when user logs in and sends password, the hash is calculated and checked against the stored value
- Integrity checks (checksum)
	- Verifies the file hasn't been altered in transit
