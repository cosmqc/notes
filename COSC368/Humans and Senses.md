### Human Information Processor
- Information received and responses given via input-output channels
- Information stored in memory
- Information processed and applied in various ways

Human factors include:
- Perceptual: how we perceive things (input)
- Cognitive: how we process information
- Motor: how we perform actions (output)
- Social: how we interact with others

## Senses
### Vision
- Primary source of info for the average person
- Can be divided into two stages:
  - Physical recpetion of the stimuli from the outside world
  - The processing and interpetation of that stimulus
- Rods -> low light, monochrome, ~100mill across retina, not fovea
- Cones -> normal light, colour, 6mill, in fovea
- Fovea -> ~= 2deg FOV, for focus
- Retina -> ~= 120deg FOV, peripheral, sensitive to movement

#### Reading
Three stages in reading process
- The visual pattern of the word is perceived
- Decoded with reference to an internal representation of language
- Language decoded with reference to an internal repr of language
- Processing includes syntactic and semantic analysis operating on phrases or sentences

Eye movement
- Saccades -> Rapid eye movements
- Fixations -> Eye nearly stationary, visual processing, when perception happens
- Regressions -> Moving backwards and forwards over text, re-reading. If text more complex -> more regressions.

### Hearing
- Second most important sense in interface design
	- People respond more quickly to auditory signals than visual
- Supports eyes-free interaction
- Short alerts grab the user's attention
- Repeating sounds are considered annoying
- Implications of sound notifications in public spaces
- Supports accessibility for visually impaired users
- Many parameters
	- Amplitude
	- Frequency
	- Direction
- Filtering capabilities (e.g. cocktail party effect)
- Can convey a lot of information about our environment
- We are selective in our hearing

Use sound for feedback, alerts, and convey system state when:
- Information is short and simple
- Information will not be refered to later
- For alerts that require the user's immediate attention
- The visual system is already overburdened
- The user is moving from place to place
- Poor illumination makes vision unreliable

### Touch
- Provides us with information about our environment
- Provides us with feedback when we interact with physical objects
- Touch is an important means of feedback in interaction
	- Feeling buttons depress is an important part of the task of pressing the button
- Supports tangible interfaces and immersive user experiences
- Provides subtle eyes-free interaction (compared to sound)
- Haptics is vitally important when other senses are impaired

Terms:
- Haptics
- Thermoreceptor: Skin receptor that responds to heat
- Mechanoreceptors: Skin receptor that responds to pressure
- Nociceptor: Skin receptor that responds to intense pressure, heat, and pain. Provides warning.
- Proprioception: Sense of limb location
- Kinaesthesia: Sense of particular limb movement
- Tactition: Skin sensations

### Olfactory (Smell)
- Great to enable multi-sensory experiences
- Can affect sensations of temperature
	- Eucalyptol for cold
	- Capsaicin for heat (in chillis)

### Taste
- Also exists, kinda weird.
- Immersive, but usually involves a crazy rig.

## Memory
> Processes that are used to acquire, store, retain and later retrieve information

![Stages of memory](/images/image-3.png)
### Sensory memory
- Exists for each sensory channel
  - Iconic memory for visual stimuli
  - Echoic memory for auditory stimuli
  - Haptic memory for tactile stimuli
- Constantly overwritten by new info coming in
- Passes to short-term via attention / focussing on the input. This filters the stimuli to only those of interest.
- Cannot be prolonged via rehearsal
- kept for <0.5s (visual) and 3-4s (auditory)

### Short-term memory
> Information we are currently aware of or thinking about
- aka active memory or working memory
- kept for approx 20-30 seconds
- input from sensory (current) or long-term (past) memory
- capacity follows Miller's law -> 7 chunks +/- 2
- two methods for measuring memory capacity
  - recall items in specific order
  - recall items in any order
- maintenance through rehearsal
- fast access (~70ms), rapid decay (~200ms)

### Long-term memory
> Typical definition of memory, information we know but aren't currently thinking about
- huge / unlimited capacity
- relatively slow access time (>100ms)
- much slower decay / forgetting

#### Episodic memory
- stores information about recent or past experiences
  - where you parked your car
  - the dinner you had w a friend a month ago

#### Semantic memory
- general knowledge / facts
  - knowledge of what a car is
  - how does an engine work? 

### Cognitive Processor
#### Reasoning
> The process where we use the knowledge we have to draw conclusions or infer something new about a domain
- Deductive reasoning -> a logical approach. general ideas -> specific conclusion
- Inductive reasoning -> specific observations -> general conclusions
- Analogical reasoning -> if two or more things are similar in respect X, they are probably similar in respect Y

#### Problem Solving
> Problem-solving is the process of finding a solution to an unfamiliar task, using the knowledge we have.
- Gestalt theory -> grouping bits of information to form a solution
- Problem space theory -> define the problem to it into multiple steps/goals
- Analogy -> Finding a problem (source) that is similar to the problem we need to solve (target) and mapping the source solution from the source to the target.

## Human Output
- Motor response times
  - Visual ~= 200ms
  - Audio ~= 150ms
  - Haptic ~= 700ms

### Power law of practice
- Performance rapidly speeds up with practice
- Tn = Cn^-a
  - Tn -> time on trial n
  - C -> time on trial 1
  - a is the learning curve

## Terms
- Isotonic -> muscle contraction yields movement (lifting weight)
- Isometric -> muscle contaction yields no movement (tensing arm)
- Spatial stability -> using consistent UI (home icon for home, far left)
