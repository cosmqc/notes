### Vision


### Hearing
- Second most important sense in interface design
	- People respond more quickly to auditory signals than visual
- Supports eyes-free interaction
- Short alerts grab the user's attention
- Repeating sounds are considered annoying
- Implications of sound notifications in public spaces
- Supports accessibility for visually impaired users
- Many parameters
	- Amplitude
	- Frequency
	- Direction
- Filtering capabilities (e.g. cocktail party effect)
- Can convey a lot of information about our environment
- We are selective in our hearing

Use sound for feedback, alerts, and convey system state when:
- Information is short and simple
- Information will not be refered to later
- For alerts that require the user's immediate attention
- The visual system is already overburdened
- The user is moving from place to place
- Poor illumination makes vision unreliable
### Touch
- Provides us with information about our environment
- Provides us with feedback when we interact with physical objects
- Touch is an important means of feedback in interaction
	- Feeling buttons depress is an important part of the task of pressing the button
- Supports tangible interfaces and immersive user experiences
- Provides subtle eyes-free interaction (compared to sound)
- Haptics is vitally important when other senses are impaired

### Olfactory
- Smell
- Great to enable multi-sensory experiences
- Can affect sensations of temperature

### Taste
