### Input Devices
Classified based on how the device is moved, is controlled, or is positioned

- Absolute (tapping on screen) vs Relative (movin) -> movement
  - a stylus for a drawing tablet will target the same point on the screen as where the stylus was tapped (absolute)
  - a physical mouse can be picked up and repositioned without the digital mouse moving (relative)

- Direct vs Indirect -> position
  - Direct means you are interacting with the exact point you want to manipulate (tapping on screen), indirect means theres some level of abstraction (physical mouse moves digital mouse)
  - Direct input will always be absolute
  - Indirect input can be either absolute or relative

- Position control, Rate control, Acceleration control

### Human Error
Takes two forms:
- Slips (right intent, wrong action)
- Mistakes (wrong intent)

#### Stroop Effect
- The delay in reaction time between congruent and incongruent stimuli
- Congruent -> Text colour is the same as the word
- Incongruent -> Text colour is not the same as the word
- Used to identify spies in WW2, as it was assumed they couldn't speak Russian. Coloured Names of colours were written incongruently in russian, If they took a long time or said the wrong colour, it was assumed they spoke Russian and were therefore a spy

#### Cognitive Dissonance
- Discomfort a person feels when their behaviour does not align with their values or beliefs
- Therefore people try to rationalize/justify beliefs (cope/seethe/mald)
- i.e. You want to be healthy but don't east a nutritious diet, you feel guilty -> "Well I've been too busy this week"
#### Homeostasis
- People maintain equilibrium
- If a system makes things easier, it'll be used to do more difficult things
- If a system makes things safer, it'll be used to do more dangerous things
#### Satisficing
- People 'make do' rather than optimize
- Strategy that aims for a adequate result, rather than an optimal one

![Linear relationship between effort and resulting value, 'good enough' is halfway on both axes](/images/image-6.png)

#### Hawthorne Effect
- Individuals modify their behaviour bc they know they're being observed
#### Fixation
- People repeatedly reuse the same solution instead of investigating new and potentially better methods
#### Negativity bias
- People tend to pay more attention and weight to negative information/stimuli than positive information/stimuli
#### Peak-End effect
- Bias that affects how people remember past events and experiences
- People remember the peak (highest satisfaction) and the end
- People prefer more frustration to less, if it finishes better

### Computer-supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)
- Artifacts - tools/objects that people use to cooperate
- Feedthrough - communication through an artifact
- Deixis - Communication paired with contextual reference ('shift that here' + point)
## Terms
- Control-to-Display Gain -> The ratio of moving distance by a device to moving distance by its corresponding pointer
