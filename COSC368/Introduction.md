### Human Computer Interaction
> Understanding, designing, implementing and evaluating user interfaces so that they better support users in carrying out their tasks.

> Studying how people interact with interactive systems and creating interactive systems adapted to people.
Main role of HCI is to manage the complexity of an interface. To design an object to be simple, clear, and do the job efficiently.

#### Goals of HCI
- Learnability - supporting quick and easy learning
- Efficiency - making it quick to perform the tasks and learn how to use the interface
- Subjective satisfaction - enjoy the experience
- Memorability - Supporting the human information processing system
- Reduce/prevent errors - consider human error and mitigate risk of it happening

#### Dark pattern
> A user interface that has been carefully created to trick users into doing thing, like buying overpriced insurance, or signing up for recurring bills.
