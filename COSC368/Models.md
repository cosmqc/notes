#### What is a model?
- Simplification/representation of reality
- Helps improve user performance and experience by comparing model outputs
- Descriptive Models vs Predictive Models
	- Descriptive models are
		- Used to help understand *how* a user will interact with an interface
		- Help us understand what is going on between the user and the system
		- Address the translation between the user's wants and what the system does
		- Help inform and improve the designs of the actual interfaces

#### Shannon's theorem
- Maximum amount of information that can be sent over a medium
- Distance = Amplitude (A) of moment; distance from cursor to center of target
- Width = Noise / Width of target 
- ID = Distance / Width
#### Fitts' Law (predictive)
- The time to acquire a target
- A function of the distance to and the size of the target
- Assesses human performance in pointing tasks
- MT = a + b * log2(D/W + 1)
#### Hick's Law (predictive)
- The time is takes to make a decision
- Increases with the number and complexity of choices
#### Miller's Law (predictive)
- The average person can only keep 7 (+/- 2) items in their working memory
- Cognitive load is the amount of information that we can hold in working memory
#### Norman's Model of Interaction

#### UISO Interaction Framework

#### Direct manipulation
- Interaction style where objects of interest are
	- visible
	- can be acted upon via physical, reversible, incremental actions
- Actions should receive immediate feedback
- A central concept of GUIs
- Helps users use the interface with minimal learning

Principles:
- Visibility of objects
	- Continuous representation of the object of interest, visibility of system state / objects
- Physical actions instead of complex syntax
	- Actions are invoked physically via clicks, button presses, and touch gestures
- Continuous rapid feedback & reversible, incremental actions
	- Easy to validate that each action caused the right result
	- Actions build on each other
- Rapid learning
	- Don't have to learn and remember syntax

Advantages:
- Easy to learn
- Low memory requirements
- Easy to undo
- Immediate feedback on user actions

Disadvantages:
- Consumes a lot of screen real estate
- May trap user in 'beginner mode'
- Repetitive physical actions -> carpal action
- Accessibility may suffer (motor/visually impaired)
