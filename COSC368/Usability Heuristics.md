- Encapsulate best practice as guidelines / rules of thumb
- Identify common pitfalls, handholding user for invalid inputs
- Simple, easy to use, 'thinking hats'

- Formative - guide design decisions
- Summative - help you evaluate systems

- Keep them in mind, but don't take them as gospel

## Advantages
- Minimalist
	- A few guidelines cover most problems
	- Easily remembered and applied
- Discount usability engineering
	- Cheap and fast
	- Can be done by experts and novices

## Disadvantages
- Very general, lots of overlaps
- Subtleties in application, up to us to think of how and where to apply them


# Nielsen's 10 Heuristics

## Visibility of system status
- Design should always keep users informed about what is happening
- No action with consequence to the user should be taken without feedback
- Via appropriate feedback
	- Error noise for successful operation will confuse
	- Informative, not verbose. Only necessary info and nothing else. Helpful / reassuring.
	- User can only store 7 (+/- 2) items in memory before they start forgetting
- Needs to be within a reasonable amount of time
	- Delayed feedback results in repeated commands, people lose trust in system
	- Response times have an effect on the user
		- 0.1s is the limit for users feeling *they* are the one doing the operation, not the computer
		- 1s is the limit for users feeling they are freely navigating the digital space, feels clunky
		- 10s is usually the limit for the user focusing on a task 
- e.g. 
	- 'You are here' indicator on mall maps
	- Elevator button lights up when you've pushed it / current floor displayed
	- Symbols to show state - battery level, wifi connection
## Match between System and Real World
- Speak the users' language in terms familiar to them
- Follow real-world conventions
- Information should be displayed in a natural and logical order
- Never assume that the developers understanding of words and objects match those of the users
- Shouldn't use similar words for similar concepts, i.e. share and done at end of form
- Skeuomorphism
	- Objects that mimic real-world counterparts in appearance and interaction
	- e.g. Place to destroy files is a rubbish bin, home menu is a house.
	- Doesn't only have to be icons, a smartwatch itself is skeuomorphic.
- Also applies to how the user feels while interacting, and expectations of the process
	- i.e.
		- Choosing movie on Netflix feels like scanning the shelves of a video store
		- Highlighting passages on PDF matches dragging a highlighter over paper 
- e.g.
	- Stovetop controls that are in the same size/positions as the heating elements
## User Control and Freedom

## Consistency and Standards

## Error Prevention

## Recognition rather than Recall

## Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
