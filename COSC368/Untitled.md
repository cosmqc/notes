### Partitipatory / Co-design
Getting users to help you design the product.
Interviews / co-design workshops:
- Helps discover user's culture, requirements, expectation
- Interview while doing their job - contextual inquiry
Explain designs:
- Get input at all design stages
- Important to have demos

**Participation** allows for more input at the design stages, including defining the agenda or the design activities

**Co-design** is where participants are treated as equals and have an equal say as the designers/researchers

Pros:
- Users are good at reacting to suggested designs (must be concrete and visible)
- They bring important 'folk' knowledge of context (stuff the design team wont know about)
Cons:
- Hard to get a good pool of end users - users sometimes reluctant to help
- Users are not expert designers - don't expect them to come up with their own ideas
- The user is not always right - don't expect them to know what they want
