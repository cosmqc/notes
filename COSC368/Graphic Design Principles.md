- Graphic deisng is not just aesthetics, it needs to support clear visual communication

### GESTALT principles
- 'unified whole' in german
- mind prefers to see whole shapes instead of lines/blocks
#### Similarity
- UI elements that share traits (size, shape, colour) seen as belonging together
- Typically used for grouping functionality
- can be used in inverse, different -> eye-catching
- i.e. underlines -> links
#### Proximity
- Elements that are close together are seen as belonging together
- Be careful of different screen sizes and orientations
#### Closure
- People fill gaps between visual elements to see a complete object whenever stimuli partially matches an object (i.e. dashed circle is still a circle)
- Achieve closure by relying on positive space, negative space, and contrast (faces/vase)
- Be careful of providing too little visual information, more info provided -> easier for user
#### Connectedness
- Elements connected to each other are seen as being part of the same unit
- Similarity and proximity are both overridden by connectedness (if two elements are closer, but connected to other more far away elements, they aren't seen as a unit)
#### Continuation
- Eye automatically follows lines and curves
- Use to guide users along desired paths in the UI
- Colour overrides continuation (see below, eye focuses on color groups instead of continuation groups)
- Elements/scrolling menus cut off by screen border let us know there is more if we keep scrolling

#### Figure/Ground (FG/BG)
- Figure -> object of focus in the foreground
- Ground -> background
- Used to
	- Direct attention to key elements of an interface
	- Provide visual cues
	- Prevent user confusion
- Can be achieved using
	- Blurred background
	- Size
	- Contrast
	- Isolation

#### Common region
- Items within a boundary are perceived as a group
- Can assume they share some common characteristic / functionality
- Can be done w borders, background colour, background pattern etc
- Zebra striping an example

### PARC principles
#### Proximity
- Group related elements
- Separate unrelated ones
#### Alignment
- Visually connect elements
- Creates a visual flow
#### Repetition
- Repeat designs through the interface
- Creates unity and consistency
#### Contrast
- Make different things look different
- Bring out dominant elements, mute lesser ones
